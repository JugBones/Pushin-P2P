## 💻 The purpose of this project is :

- Creating P2P Protocol on top of the UDP
- Simulating packet loss of data
- HTTP-like operations such as GET and POST

## Testing

In order to test the protocol, two end-systems are needed. This can be done in the form of multiple VMs or two operating systems for both receiving and sending files.

Initialize Git:

```console
git init
```

Clone the repository:

```console
git clone https://github.com/JugBones/CompNetwork-Assignment-L4BC.git
```

List branches:

```console
git branch
```

Create new branch:

```console
git branch <new_branch_name>
```

Switch branch:

```console
git switch <branch_name>
```

Now run the python scripts for the testing of the POST and GET functions
